Create a Pandora station from a Play Music Playlist

## The Problem

I use Google Play Music a lot while working. Their recommendations are good, but Pandora has been a long-time favorite when it comes to discovering new music and there has been no match to their Music Genome Project so far. All of my music is stored in Play Music, and it would be a pain to manually keep importing music between the two services. 

## The Solution

Using the Google Play Music API, retrieve playlists, and create a station on Pandora using the songs from that playlist. And then get those sweet sweet recommendations coming!
